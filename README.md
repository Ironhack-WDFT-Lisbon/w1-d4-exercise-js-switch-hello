# w1-d4-exercise-js-switch-hello

Let’s write an improved version of the ‘Hello, world!’ program. Let’s ask the user in which language they want to see the message. You must have, at least, three different languages.

1. If the user wants the message in Spanish, you have to log in to the console “Hola, mundo!”.
2. If the user wants the message in French, you have to log in to the console “Bonjour tout le monde”.
3. Finally, if we don’t have the indicated language, we will show “Hello, world!”.
